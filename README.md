Demonstration of Facebook oauth used in a Django app.
============

This Django blog like application.
This sample application can be used to give an idea on how django works.

All works (browsing, urls, views and templates). Except by the models that actually were not done.
 
But the main point is do a demonstration of facebook oauth capabilities. And show what a Django is aimed to do with o auth.
